# Scripting Snippets

I originally created this repository to house several small script files from various languages as a part of a college course where we learned scripting in a multitude of languages. Now, being finished with the course, I use this repository to hold my script files, old and new, that don't necessarily warrant a separate project. Hopefully this will be of use to someone other than me.

It bears mentioning that the older the code is, the less it represents what I would write nowadays.
