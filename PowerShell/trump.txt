Wow. Thank you very much. Hello, Louisiana. Hello, Louisiana. You know, I happened to watch a football game last weekend. That wasn't a bad game. It wasn't a bad game. That wasn't too bad, was it? But I'm thrilled to be back in the beautiful bayou state with thousands of hardworking American citizens who believe in God, family and country. But I'm down for a reason. This Saturday, the eyes of history are looking upon the great people of Louisiana. Saturday, remember Saturday, you've got to vote on Saturday. It's a close one and you're going to have a great Republican Governor. You know that. You're going to have a great Republican Governor. He's going to bring down the car insurance and bring down your taxes. If you want to defend your values, your jobs and your freedom, then you need to replace radical, liberal John Bel Edwards with a true Louisiana patriot, Eddie Rispone. Eddie Rispone, great guy, loves you still. In two days, I really need you, but you really need you to send a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington.
